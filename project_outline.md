## Project Title
MLB Win/Loss Predictions

## Team Members
Cuong Ha, Ben Spiegel, Kenny Pham, Lydia Ciummo

## Project Description
Using data from the 2022 MLB season, train and test a machine learning model that predicts whether or not a team will win or lose a game

## Research Questions to Answer
Which model is able to make the most accurate predictions?
Will the model perform differently for different teams? For example a team with mostly wins or losses vs. a more even distribution
Which features are the most impactful for predicting the outcome? How does adding or removing certain features affect the accuracy?

## Datasets to be used
Use the pybaseball python module which pulls data from baseballsavant.com

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks
* Acquiring data/preprocessing
* Writing initial code to implement the models
* Testing different inputs and recording the results
* Write up analysis/compose final notebook
